			This was a personal side project where I could capture and upload hikes that I took (via KML files) and photos that I captured along the way and the site would showcase my hikes with Google Maps and the photos shown at the location they were taken. I built it with its own REST API which the site itself uses. I created an admin area where I could upload the hikes and photos by location, and also edit and delete them. I also wrote my own form validation for javascript and PHP as an exercise in creating a good UI on the front-end and an easy way to reuse validation rules on both the front-end and back-end.<br />

			A Cincinnati start-up where I was brought on as the technical co-founder. The site allowed users to search for outdoor activities based on the user's location and the specific activity they were looking to do. Content was curated from multiple sources including an outdoor book publisher, publicly available content, and user submitted content. Initially I helped maintain and expand the existing version of the site and managed an outside source for our first mobile app. When redesigning the experience, I took over the architecture and planning for the technology stack. I rebuilt the site from the ground up with a new database schema, framework, API, and functionality. An iPhone developer was brought on who I coordindated with on our new mobile app. I eventually had to leave because funding ran out.<br />

			A site I co-founded and built. We began addressing the problem of high priced textbooks by experimenting with a completely free college textbook exchange. Students could list the textbooks they were done with and view available textbooks from other students to create exchanges. The site received many accolades from students who were previously dissatisfied with the other options available to them. As a result, students from over 1,300 schools nationwide joined and posted over $1,000,000 in college textbooks. We eventually sold the site.<br />

			PubliciTweet was a social media marketing application that I co-founded and built from the ground up. It aimed at providing in-depth analytics for Twitter campaigns. The analytics went beyond the number of clicks and provided detailed information on which users had the most referrals and the overall reach. It allowed businesses, musicians or other groups to communicate with their followers on Twitter and track the success of those campaigns. The site provided tools to send mass direct messages, determine which followers referred the most clicks, and where the clicks came from. We eventually sold the site.<br />

			Envisioned and built by <a href="https://github.com/jmathai/" target="_blank">Jaisen Mathai</a>, I helped code a few sections and bug test and fix a few others. It is a fast, easy, clean and RESTful PHP framework. It does not do a lot of magic under the hood and is, by design, very simple and very powerful. It has an interesting RESTful API module where internal calls do not have to make an HTTP request, but still use the same API that external sources call.<br />
