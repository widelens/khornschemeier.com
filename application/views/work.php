			I also used my personal site as a way to learn LESS, responsive design, Twitter Bootstrap, Google Web Fonts, and to get more comfortable with Git. One challenge with LESS is compiling it every time. I used a PHP class, called lessphp and written by Leaf Corcoran, to compile the LESS on the fly instead of doing it manually and uploading the CSS. This turned out well as I created a URL route for anything that is a less file to go to a controller to run the library to compile the LESS to CSS, and then the controller sets the header and echoes out the CSS. You can see this by going to <a href="http://khornschemeier.com/less/global.less" target="_blank">http://khornschemeier.com/less/global.less</a>. I really liked doing the responsive design and think this is going to be the way to go to make web apps work well on any size screen.<br />

			I was the first employee of Photagious (aka FotoFlix), a digital photo sharing startup, in 2006. The web site is no longer available, but it was built on a LAMP stack and starting in this position I had no prior knowledge of PHP or MySQL. I brought myself up to speed very quickly and helped the CTO architect and build a revised site from the ground up in the first 3 months. We were also in need of a desktop uploader for Windows, something I was also unfamiliar with building, and I learned C#, the .NET platform, and Winforms to get it done. I also took the lead on building the site forums and user profile pages. My biggest takeaway was a lasting friendship with the CTO, Jaisen Mathai, who went on to work at Yahoo! and then to his own open-source software company, <a href="https://trovebox.com/" target="_blank">https://trovebox.com/</a>.<br />

			Jaisen and I have worked on many side projects together as co-founders since we both have an entrepreneurial drive and passion for technology. The first side project was TexbookRevolt. Originally we wanted to save students money on textbooks by letting them freely swap the ones they weren't using. It was a decent idea in theory but wasn't working out, so we changed to a peer-to-peer rental platform. As co-founder I helped build the entire site, taking lead roles in integrating with the Stamps.com API so students could easily print out prepaid postage and the Amazon.com API for finding and listing book data. I also lead the front-end work. We had a few challenges, one of which was how to determine locks when a textbook was placed in a student's shopping cart since there was very limited stock. In the end we decided to sell the site although it doesn't look to be working the same as it had.<br />

		<p>
			Jaisen and I teamed up again on a spin-off of TextbookRevolt called TheScholarApp. Our goal was to provide a platform for students to collaborate with their classmates outside of the classroom. We made this on the Facebook platform to use Facebook's social credibility and sharing. Our service allowed students to choose their college and classes, and then within those classes they could view their syllabus and receive notifications on upcoming exams, see who else was in their class to connect with, create discussions, and share their class notes. The colleges were curated from online sources and the classes were curated from teachers and students submissions. I helped build the entire platform and had major roles in integrating with the Facebook API to make the site viewable on the Facebook canvas, the first time experience flow in choosing their college and classes, and the crowdsourcing of the classes. The project was meant to complement TextbookRevolt and after TextbookRevolt was sold, and with little traction on The Scholar App, we decided to shut down the service.<br />

		<p>
			Jaisen and I teamed up yet again for PubliciTweet. We built a service for businesses to create and analyze their Twitter marketing campaigns. The business could create a new tweet and set when it would be sent and if it would be a direct message to all followers or on their public timeline. We tracked the total reach of the tweet (how many people the business sent it to plus the retweets), how many people clicked a link in the tweet, which followers had the most referrals, a graphed timeline of clicks over time, and a Google Map showing where the users were who were clicking. I helped build the entire site and was most integral in the database design, front-end work, using the Flot PHP library for the graphs, and integrating the Google Maps. A challenge for me at the time was creating the graphs and the Google Map with markers because I hadn't used either library before, but I was able to get them done quickly. We sold this site as well and the buyer used the codebase but didn't keep the original site running.<br />

			I worked at another startup in Cincinnati called Venturepax. Originally intended as a resource for people to find outdoor activities based on their location and the activity they wanted to do. I was hired on as the CTO and co-founder after the site had been established from multiple outsourced teams over the course of a few years. One challenge was to quickly get up to speed on a very large and mangled code-base to be able to fix existing bugs, maintain the site, and add new features. I also managed an outsourced mobile app developer while creating a REST API for them to consume. After the decision was made to redesign the site and the user experience, I took over the architecture and planning for the technology stack. I rebuilt the site by myself. One challenge was creating a new database schema and writing the scripts to convert the old user data over to the new schema. I also used the Codeigniter MVC framework to better structure the code, rewrote the API, and created an admin section for easy viewing and editing of users, their data, and site-wide data. Funding ran out and I had to leave. The site was turned over to cheaper outsourcing and still exists<br />

I also created an API from the start and used it to build the site. The site is still a work in progress.<br />
