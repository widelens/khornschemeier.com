		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a software engineer generalist with a computer science background in C/C++, algorithms, and data structures, and over 10 years of full-stack web development experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy spending my days with my beautiful wife and awesomely energetic 6-month-old son. We love to get outside to hike, kayak, and bike. We also love to travel and this year are making trips to San Francisco, a to-be-determined National Park out West, and Chicago where I'll be running the marathon.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love to learn new things and have a ton of hobbies because of it. Photography is by far the biggest one as I love taking photos of my family, but I also enjoy golf, soccer, tennis, astronomy, reading, writing, and tons more. I have a broad range of knowledge across many subject and deep knowledge in a few. And, to a fault, I have a lot of ideas and a lot of programming side projects to keep my skills sharp.
